## Domain Description
At a glance, the EDUCATION domain tells the internet users who you are and what you do.The EDUCATION domain was recieved with passion by public schools, private schools, universities, online courses and degrees, charter programs and any brand to promote and spread educational content on the Internet. The EDUCATION domain can be trusted and targeted, which is a natural choice for educational programs on the Internet. The Education domain is universal and attracts attention, adding a serious boost to your personal and professional brand. 
We all come to the world with natural curiosity and motivation to learn, but some lose this ability as we age. Many factors shape our individual tendencies for the learning process, and education is a critical context that can influence our subsequent attitudes towards the possession and growth of knowledge. True learning is a lifetime process. But in order to continue to succeed, children must find that they are happy to learn, so they can develop the level of ongoing motivation needed for long-term achievement. Seven factors endorse motivation:
a. Challange
b. Curiosity
c. Control
d. Fantasy
e. Competition
f. Cooperation
g. Recognition

## Tasks Performed
A task is an activity which you have to do. The actual reason of using a device or interacting with an interface is to accomplish a task.
Following are the task:

### Task 1: Attendance

Manuals methods, such as paper rolls and calling, can be time consuming. Teachers must sacrifice valueable time, and applicants are often responsible gathering attendance reports and transferring data manually to digital recordings. Although instructors require less time, student registration sheets can be easily filled out for friends, but applicants still need transfer time.
Benefits for attendance are: Accuracy, Real time tracing, Flexibility, Efficiency. 


### Task 2: Feedback

Technology can help teachers to provide feedback to students to review their work. It may help students to improve their work.


### Task 3: Connecting classrooms to community

It's easy to forget that student success at school also depends on what happens outside of school. Involving students and teachers with the wider community can inhance their learning. For example, universities and companies have helped the community improve the quality of teaching in schools. Industrial engineers and scientists often play mentoring role wiith teachers.


### Task 4: Team work

The real goal is interaction, the interaction between two people, partners or small groups. Student assessments have shown impressive success in understanding. In addition, students improve their ability to work with one another and bring their design ideas to a real audience. It can also help students to develop their skills and confidence level.


### Task 5: Time

The amount of time student going and returning from an institute saved. The advantage for this is concentration on learning increases because of time saved, improve time management, Less fuel consumption.


### Task 6: Fee Vouchar

Student's feel difficulty in going here and there for just a paper work. In online system, they can easily submit their dues by mailing.



## Gulf of Execution and Evaluation

The aim for this project is to organize students and teachers interaction with the help of provided options or tasks they both will be performing and able to organize their work or learning material in one place. From teacherâ€™s point of view, they can organize the lecture material and quizzes on oneside and as for students they will have their own options to discover tasks relating to their lectures. Our goal is to give teachers and student both relaxation in using our app.
